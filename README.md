# Menu Music Randomizer

Used with the randomizer folder plugin (https://github.com/Coolsonickirby/arc-randomizer) to randomize music after each fight. This randomizes the default menu song. Drag and drop songs into the input folder, and then place the output folder in your switch's randomizer folder. You can download from the code button above if you have python installed, or alternatively the release folder

## Input

Here is where you'll put the `.nus3audio` and `.nus3bank` files. The names don't matter, but keep the `.nus3audio` file the same name as its `.nus3bank` counterpart. It is preferred that you include both files

## Output

After running this program, you'll want to place this folder inside `ultimate/randomizer` and then rename it to something like "Random Menu Music"

## Template

Keep this folder, don't rename or change it

## ui

If you beat world of light, you'll have more menu music. You can change the frequency to only have the main menu show up, or you can drag this folder into the Output folder / `ultimate/randomizer/[Menu Randomizer Folder]` and it'll only play the menu music
